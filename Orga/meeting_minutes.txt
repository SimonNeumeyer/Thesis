-------------------
- english
- tex
- Use chapters intro, related work, goal, methodology
- rather don't incorporate graph embeddings
- formulate more research questions (chapter goal/research questions)
- analyse how many DAGs possible (how large is search space)
  resp. how does it grow in O(n) depending on some parameter n
- beware skip connections in DAGs
- literature: hutter survey -> basics (maybe for chapter intro),
  darts+, [3] [4] in mail (don't focus too much on them, just for analysing combinatorics)

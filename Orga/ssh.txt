open: add key to ssh key agent
https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

question: do I already have a ssh key agent installed?
does agent need to be running whenever I want to use ssh authorization?

I won't go further now as it is still convenient in my situation
to authenticate via user, password, as I won't need to push often
